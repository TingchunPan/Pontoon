# Pontoon

This is the assignment 3 for OOP module.

The game of pontoon for the assignment is as below (summarized from the instruction):

Pontoon is a card game. The main attribute of this game is that the players are trying to get a hand of cards with the value 21 or less, but as close to 21 as possible if less than 21.

A hand of cards with a value of more than 21 is ‘bust’ and is not valid.

The game is often played by two players with one acting as the ‘bank’.

We simply consider it a game of two equal players.

At the start of the game, each player gets two cards dealt face down.

One of the 2 players turns both of their cards.

If the value of their two cards sums to less than 16, they must receive another card, or, they must ‘twist’.

If the value of their cards is between 16 and 21 (inclusive) they can choose to ‘stick’.

Once the player is either happy with the value of their cards (and it has not exceeded 21) they stick and the game moves to the other player.

The other player follows the same process and attempts to get a better hand than the first player.
